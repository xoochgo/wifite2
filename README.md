Wifite
======

This repo is a complete re-write of [`wifite`](https://github.com/derv82/wifite), a Python script for auditing wireless networks.

Wifite runs existing wireless-auditing tools for you. Stop memorizing command arguments & switches!

Wifite is designed to use all known methods for retrieving the password of a wireless access point (router).  These methods include:
1. WPS: The [Offline Pixie-Dust attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Offline_brute-force_attack)
1. WPS: The [Online Brute-Force PIN attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup#Online_brute-force_attack)<br>
   WPS: The [Offline NULL PIN attack](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/wiki/Introducing-a-new-way-to-crack-WPS:-Option--p-with-an-Arbitrary-String)
2. WPA: The [WPA Handshake Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
3. WPA: The [PMKID Hash Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
4. WPA3: The [SAE Handshake Capture](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) + offline crack.
5. WPA3: Transition mode downgrade attacks (force WPA2 on mixed networks).
6. WEP: Various known attacks against WEP, including *fragmentation*, *chop-chop*, *aireplay*, etc.
7. **Evil Twin**: Rogue AP attack with captive portal for credential capture.
8. WIFI Signal jammer, block specific accesspoints or multiple.
   signal jamming only works for specific Atheros WiFi chipsets. 

Run wifite, select your targets, and Wifite will automatically start trying to capture or crack the password.

### Quick Start with Dual Interfaces

If you have two wireless adapters, wifite can use them simultaneously for significantly improved performance:

```bash
# Automatic dual interface mode (wifite detects and assigns interfaces)
sudo wifite --dual-interface

# Evil Twin attack with dual interfaces (30-50% faster)
sudo wifite --dual-interface --eviltwin

# WPA attack with dual interfaces (continuous capture, no packet loss)
sudo wifite --dual-interface --wpa

# Manual interface selection
sudo wifite --interface-primary wlan0 --interface-secondary wlan1
```

**Benefits:** Eliminates mode switching, enables parallel operations, improves reliability. See the [Dual Interface Guide](docs/DUAL_INTERFACE_GUIDE.md) for complete details.

### WPA3 Attack Support

Wifite now includes comprehensive WPA3-SAE attack capabilities with automatic detection and intelligent strategy selection.

#### WPA3 Attack Strategies

Wifite automatically selects the best attack strategy based on the target network:

1. **Transition Mode Downgrade (80-90% success rate)**
   - Automatically detects WPA2/WPA3 mixed networks
   - Forces clients to connect using WPA2 instead of WPA3
   - Captures standard WPA2 handshake for cracking
   - Fastest and most reliable method for transition mode networks

2. **SAE Handshake Capture (60-70% success rate)**
   - Captures WPA3-SAE authentication handshakes
   - Converts to hashcat format (mode 22000) for offline cracking
   - Works on pure WPA3 networks
   - Requires GPU for efficient cracking

3. **Passive Capture (50-60% success rate)**
   - Used when PMF (Protected Management Frames) is required
   - Waits for natural client reconnections
   - No deauthentication attacks possible
   - Slower but works on PMF-protected networks

4. **Dragonblood Exploitation (40-50% on vulnerable APs)**
   - Detects known WPA3 vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-13377, etc.)
   - Attempts timing-based attacks on vulnerable implementations
   - Automatically used when vulnerabilities detected

#### Basic WPA3 Usage

```bash
# Attack all networks including WPA3 (automatic detection)
sudo wifite

# Target only WPA3 networks
sudo wifite --wpa3-only

# Force SAE capture (skip downgrade attempts on transition mode)
sudo wifite --force-sae

# Disable downgrade attacks (pure SAE only)
sudo wifite --no-downgrade

# Check for Dragonblood vulnerabilities without attacking
sudo wifite --check-dragonblood
```

#### WPA3 Tool Requirements

For WPA3 support, you need these tools with minimum versions:

* **hcxdumptool v6.0.0+** - For capturing SAE handshakes
* **hcxpcapngtool v6.0.0+** - For converting SAE captures to hashcat format
* **hashcat v6.0.0+** - For cracking SAE hashes (mode 22000)

Install on Kali Linux:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hcxdumptool hcxtools hashcat
```

**📖 For detailed installation instructions, version requirements, and troubleshooting, see [WPA3 Tool Requirements Guide](docs/WPA3_TOOL_REQUIREMENTS.md)**

#### Understanding WPA3 Network Types

* **WPA3-only** - Pure WPA3 networks (requires SAE capture)
* **WPA3-Transition** - Mixed WPA2/WPA3 (downgrade attack possible)
* **PMF Required** - Protected Management Frames enabled (no deauth possible)
* **PMF Optional** - PMF supported but not required (deauth works)

Wifite automatically detects these configurations and selects the optimal attack strategy.

#### WPA3 Attack Examples

```bash
# Attack a specific WPA3 network by BSSID
sudo wifite -b AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

# Attack WPA3 with custom timeout (default: 300 seconds)
sudo wifite --wpa3-timeout 600

# Crack captured WPA3 handshake with wordlist
sudo wifite --crack --dict /path/to/wordlist.txt

# Verbose mode to see WPA3 detection and strategy selection
sudo wifite -vv
```

#### WPA3 Troubleshooting

**No WPA3 networks detected:**
- Ensure your wireless adapter supports monitor mode on 5GHz (many WPA3 networks use 5GHz)
- Use `-5` flag to scan 5GHz channels
- Verify hcxdumptool is installed and up-to-date

**PMF prevents deauthentication:**
- This is expected behavior on WPA3 networks with PMF required
- Wifite automatically switches to passive capture mode
- Wait for natural client reconnections (may take longer)

**SAE handshake capture fails:**
- Ensure hcxdumptool v6.0.0+ is installed
- Check that clients are actively connecting to the network
- Try increasing timeout with `--wpa3-timeout`

**Hashcat cracking is slow:**
- WPA3-SAE cracking is computationally intensive
- Use GPU acceleration (CUDA/OpenCL) for best performance
- Consider using cloud-based cracking services for large wordlists


### Resume Feature

Wifite automatically saves your attack progress and allows you to resume interrupted sessions:

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start an attack (progress is automatically saved)
sudo wifite

# If interrupted (Ctrl+C, crash, power loss), resume with:
sudo wifite --resume

# Resume the most recent session automatically:
sudo wifite --resume-latest

# Resume a specific session by ID:
sudo wifite --resume-id session_20250126_120000
```

#### How It Works
* **Automatic Saving** - Progress is saved after each target completion
* **Session Files** - Stored in `~/.wifite/sessions/` with secure permissions (600)
* **Smart Filtering** - Automatically skips completed and failed targets
* **Configuration Restore** - Preserves original attack parameters and settings
* **Multiple Sessions** - Manage multiple interrupted sessions with selection interface

#### Session Management
```bash
# List and choose from available sessions
sudo wifite --resume

# Clean up old session files (older than 7 days)
sudo wifite --clean-sessions
```

#### What's Saved
* Target list and attack progress
* Completed and failed targets
* Attack configuration (wordlist, timeouts, attack types)
* Original interface and settings

#### What's NOT Saved (for security)
* Captured passwords or keys
* Handshake files
* PMKID hashes

#### Troubleshooting

**Q: No session files found**
* Start a new attack first - sessions are created after target selection
* Check `~/.wifite/sessions/` directory exists and has proper permissions

**Q: Corrupted session file**
* Wifite will detect and offer to delete corrupted files
* Use `--clean-sessions` to manually remove problematic sessions

**Q: Interface changed**
* Wifite will detect if the original interface is unavailable
* You'll be prompted to use the current interface instead

**Q: Session not resuming correctly**
* Ensure you're using the same version of wifite
* Check that all required tools are still installed
* Use `--resume` to see session details before confirming

Performance Tips
-----------------

### For Best Results
* **Use a dedicated wireless adapter** - USB adapters often perform better than built-in cards
* **Position matters** - Get closer to target networks for better signal strength
* **Choose the right channel** - Use `-c <channel>` to focus on specific channels
* **Limit concurrent attacks** - Use `--first 5` to attack only the strongest targets first

### Speed Optimization
* **PMKID first** - Try `--pmkid-only` for fastest WPA/WPA2 attacks (no clients needed)
* **Skip WPS on modern routers** - Use `--no-wps` on newer routers that likely have WPS disabled
* **Use wordlists efficiently** - Start with common passwords, use `--dict <wordlist>`
* **WPA3 transition mode** - Downgrade attacks are faster than pure SAE capture
* **Target WPA2 first** - WPA2 is faster to crack than WPA3-SAE

### Resource Management
* **Monitor system resources** - Watch CPU and memory usage during long scans
* **Regular breaks** - Stop and restart wifite periodically during extended sessions
* **Clean up** - Remove old capture files and temporary data regularly

### Core Features
* **Less bugs**
   * Cleaner process management. Does not leave processes running in the background (the old `wifite` was bad about this).
   * No longer "one monolithic script". Has working unit tests. Pull requests are less-painful!
* **Speed**
   * Target access points are refreshed every second instead of every 5 seconds.
* **Accuracy**
   * Displays realtime Power level of currently-attacked target.
   * Displays more information during an attack (e.g. % during WEP chopchop attacks, Pixie-Dust step index, etc)
* **Educational**
   * The `--verbose` option (expandable to `-vv` or `-vvv`) shows which commands are executed & the output of those commands.
   * This can help debug why Wifite is not working for you. Or so you can learn how these tools are used.
* More-actively developed, with some help from the awesome open-source community.
* Python 3 support.
* Sweet new ASCII banner.


Troubleshooting
---------------

### Common Issues

**"Too many open files" error:**
- This has been fixed in v2.7.3 with enhanced process management
- If you still encounter this, try reducing concurrent attacks or restart wifite

**Permission denied errors:**
- Ensure you're running wifite with `sudo`
- Check that your wireless interface supports monitor mode
- Verify all required tools are installed and accessible

**Interface not found:**
- Run `sudo airmon-ng` to see available interfaces
- Use `sudo airmon-ng start <interface>` to enable monitor mode manually
- Some interfaces require specific drivers or firmware

**WPS attacks failing:**
- Ensure `reaver` and/or `bully` are installed and up-to-date
- Some routers have WPS disabled or rate-limiting enabled
- Try the `--pixie` flag for Pixie-Dust attacks specifically

**Handshake capture issues:**
- Ensure clients are connected to the target network
- Use `--deauth-count` to increase deauth attempts
- Some networks may require longer capture times

**WPA3 attack issues:**
- Verify hcxdumptool v6.0.0+ and hashcat v6.0.0+ are installed
- Check if PMF is preventing deauth attacks (wifite will notify you)
- For transition mode networks, downgrade attacks have highest success rate
- SAE handshake capture requires active client connections
- Use `-vv` to see detailed WPA3 detection and strategy information

**WPA3 cracking performance:**
- WPA3-SAE is significantly slower to crack than WPA2
- GPU acceleration is highly recommended (10-100x faster)
- Ensure hashcat is using your GPU: `hashcat -I` to list devices
- Consider starting with smaller, targeted wordlists
